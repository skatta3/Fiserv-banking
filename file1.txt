The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took a jibe at Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday over its 'Maha' Rally against the Centre's ordinance on control of services in the national capital. The saffron party claimed that the AAP rally was a "big flop" and it was nothing but a "failed attempt to hide corruption". The leaders from the BJP hit out at the Delhi Chief Minister and AAP National Convenor, Arvind Kejriwal, by talking about the Delhi Excise Policy case and the alleged corruption that he did in "making his palace".

Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said, "This is not a grand rally of AAP but a failed attempt to hide corruption. Today Kejriwal should tell the public why he wasted public money on building his palace? Kejriwal should tell the public why he mixed the poison of drugs in Delhi?"
